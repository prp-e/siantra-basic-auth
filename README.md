# Basic Authorization for [Sinatra](http://sinatrarb.com)

I read [this document](https://gist.github.com/amscotti/1384524) on how to work with Sinatra's sessions, and then decided to write this sample. 
This sample includes a real database and signup form. 

## Used libraries 
1. Sinatra
2. Mongoid (ODM for MongoDB)

## TODO
Everything done!
